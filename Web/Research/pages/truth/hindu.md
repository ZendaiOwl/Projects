[ #1 ][1]: Truth has a great significance in Hinduism, as an aspect of Brahman, a characteristic of existence, the support of creation, a quality of gods, moral virtue, philosophical concept, spiritual practice, instruction, and the personification of Dharma (Law) and Rta (Order).

[ #2 ][2]: Where there is truth, there is Dharma; where there is Dharma, there is light; and where there is light, there is happiness. Conversely, where there is falsehood, there is Adharma; where there is Adharma, there is darkness; and where there is darkness, there is sorrow.

[ #3 ][3]: A Hindu views the entire universe as Godâ€™s and everything in the universe as God. Hindus believe that each person is intrinsically divine and the purpose of life is to seek and realise the divinity within all of us.

The Hindu belief is totally non-exclusive and accepts all other faiths and religious paths.
An ancient Vedic text says that God or Truth is one and wise people refer to it by very many names.

Hindus believe that no one religion is exclusively true, that all major faiths are aspects of the one universal, all-encompassing truth, and that there are many paths to seek and experience religious understanding and enlightenment.
