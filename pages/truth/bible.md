# Truth - Bible

[_Home_]({{ site.url }})

A small amount of material I gathered from other sources about truth in the various religious perspectives which in a large degree are a big part of the foundation of our societies.

The reason I choose to focus on truth, is because I wanted to highlight it's importance.

[ #1 ][7]: As is apparent by simply listing key biblical passages that speak to this subject, honesty and telling the truth are highly valued by God and are considered an integral part of a life of integrity and faithfulness to him.

The Mosaic law commands that God’s people do not lie or deceive each other (Leviticus 19:11) or give false testimony about another (Exodus 20:16).

The Psalmist describes the person whose walk is blameless and righteous as speaking the truth from the heart (Psalm 15:2).

The New Testament echoes this when it connects honesty and truthfulness with the believer’s new life in Christ (Colossians 3:9).

One of the first manifestations of the believer putting off the old self and putting on the new self in Christ is a commitment to honesty (Ephesians 4:24-25).


[ #2 ][8]: The Bible has a great deal to say about truth, particularly the truth about God and our relationship to him as human beings created with God-like qualities.

On practically every page of the New Testament this emphasis is apparent.

The gospel message concerning the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is spoken of as “the word of truth” (Ephesians 1:13; Colossians 1:5; James 1:18), or often simply as “the truth”.

Christians are spoken about as those who “belong to the truth” (1 John 3:19).

God the Father’s word is truth (John 17:17); God the Son declared himself to be the truth (14:6), and God the Holy Spirit is spoken of as the “Spirit of truth” (1 John 5:6).
