### Vision and Story

_Can we find a unifying story that will guide us as we make our way forward?<br><br>What destiny might we envision and pursue, such that we are maximally fortified against anxiety and despair, motivated by faith and hope, and voluntarily united in our pursuit of a flourishing and abundant world?_

I don't know üôè but yes, I have hope, everything is in balance.

---

### Responsible Citizenship

_How do we facilitate the development of a responsible and educated citizenry?<br><br>How might we encourage individuals to reflect and to act so that they adopt full voluntary responsibility for themselves, present and future, as well as their families and communities?_

I don't know, these are some of the things that come to mind for me so far

+ **¬ß** Cultivate the individual
+ **¬ß** Reassess and reconnect with our fundamental values
+ **¬ß** Gather & save our body of knowledge within a distributed network
+ **¬ß** Financial stability
+ **¬ß** Distributed governance
+ **¬ß** Encourage families

---

### Family and Social Fabric

_What is the proper role for the family, the community, and the nation in creating the conditions for prosperity?<br><br>How might we effectively conceptualize, value and reward the sacrificial, long-term, peaceful, child-centered intimate relationships upon which psychological integrity and social stability most fundamentally depend?_

I don't know, another complicated question...

Here is some of my fragmented thoughts

#### Family

_A home_

+ **¬ß** Brings meaning to us as human beings
+ **¬ß** Bedrock of society
+ **¬ß** Brings the next generation into this world & with it, our species survival
+ **¬ß** Passes on our values & virtues to live on within the next generation

#### Community

_‚ÄùA unified body of individuals‚Äù_

A way to describe many individuals by a distinct commonality or unity, can also be used to describe a belonging within a group of people or the past, present and future selves of the individual.

To be honest I was a little stumped about the "community" part in this question and I think I need more time to think about it.

#### Nation

The country of which we live and often times are born in, that protects our way of life, which our ancestors in previous generations handed off to us as a legacy, that we in turn will shape for future generations to come.

One such legacy is democracy where the sovereign individual that seeks the truth is at the foundation

Is a nation with a democratic society a community of sovereign individuals?

Family is necessary for the prosperity of the nation, our species and provides the happiness & meaning human beings need, instead of the immediate momentary & hollow happiness or joy that comes from our external pursuit of happiness.

### Free Exchange and Good Governance

_How do we govern our corporate, social and political organizations so that we promote free exchange and abundance while protecting ourselves against the ever-present danger of cronyism and corruption?<br><br>How can we continue to gain from the genius of unbridled human innovation and the productive reciprocity of voluntary production and free exchange, while protecting ourselves against the tendency of successful organizations to degenerate into a state of wilfully blind and narrowly self-serving authoritarianism?_

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

I don't know

Responsibility and accountability for our actions while remaining truthful is incredibly important and it seems that many people online from various parts of the world, in different ways, feel or think that current political, governing, judicial and financial systems are somewhat lacking in this area at the moment.

With too much consolidation of authority at a centralised institution or figure that is too susceptile for the temptations that corrupt us as human beings and the all the blind spots that comes from being human.

I keep coming back to a thought that we need to distribute the responsibility and authority to the people more. I've listed some points below which I think are important for us to understand and incorporate into our societies as we are moving forward together. 

#### Financial stability

+ [ ] TODO Get link to the sources

Peg the financial system to something which is difficult for people to arbitrarily manipulate or increase the supply of at whim.

Facilitate an environment that allows people to gain a long-term view into the future so we can collectively make the world a better place instead of all struggling just to get through the day with a short-term view.

#### English Common Law

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

#### Free markets

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

#### Austrian school of economics

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

#### The soil

I don't know, but I think there is a point in that a large part of the coming issues that we face as a species and civilization can be alleviated by incentivizing a different kind of soil management, one that increases the organic content in the soil.

To what degree though?

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

+ [ ] TODO Gather the references to the published research papers from [consciousplanet](https://consciousplanet.org) website & gather links to the research papers

#### Distributed networks

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

+ Governance
+ Law
+ Knowledge
+ Education
+ Finance
+ Healthcare
+ Increase participation in the democratic governing process & the meaning of the interaction
+ Distribute & disperse the governing authority to the people

#### Distributed democratic governance

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

+ Government or state signed key distributed to citizens already on record
+ Makes peer-to-peer governing & voting system possible with verifiable pseudo-anonymous identities
+ Distribute our democratic governance to the people and increase participation by the people

I don't know, but the model of having one vote of influence every 4 years where we are presented with the "same choices" every time is, it doesn't have the appearance of working properly to its fullest potential anymore, seemingly not keeping up in the age of information and leaving people feeling uneasy.


#### Estonias e-governance model

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

+ How do they store their citizens data?
+ How is it accessed & by whom?
+ What is recorded & what is visible?
+ Who is able to access what data & when?
+ How does their governance, judicial, healthcare and educational systems work, are they also digitalised and if so, to what degree?
+ What benefits & downsides have they noticed so far?
+ Which areas were costly to change & transition?
+ Which areas were painful for people during the transition?

### Energy and Resources

_How do we provide the energy and other resources upon which all economies depend in a manner that is inexpensive, reliable, safe and efficient, including in the developing world?<br><br>How do we ensure provision of the energy and other resources crucial to our shared security and opportunity in a manner that is inexpensive, reliable, safe, efficient and widely and universally accessible?_

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

I don't know

If I have to answer, I'll say Thorium, for now

I've realized I need to look into this area a lot more

### Environmental Stewardship 

_How should we take the responsibility of environmental stewardship seriously?<br><br>How might we properly pursue the environmental stewardship that most truly serves the needs and wants of all individuals today, tomorrow and into the foreseeable future?_

I don't know but I did go through the material of a movement to save the soil & our farmers.

I wonder why it wasn't mentioned together with the Dutch farmers?

I also wonder, why did the Dutch government at the time attempt to do the opposite of what was being asked for in regards to the save soil movement?

---

Incentives for our farmers to increase the organic content in the soil to minimum 3-6%.

I don't know but it seems this can alleviate or significantly reduce many issues at the same time after reading much of the material I could find, I think something like this is a good first step. 

#### Soil

+ [ ] TODO Gather information

A large part of the coming issues that we face as a species and civilization can be alleviated by incentivizing a different kind of soil management, one that increases the organic content in the soil.

The soil is everything, the very source of all our lives, it is also the source which sustains us all.

The micro-organisms and earth worms in the soil are the ones that breaks down the organic material into nutrients and food for the plants, which we later consume.

They are the foundation of the carbon-cycle on this planet, the cycle which is often called "The Cycle of Life", something which seems to have been forgotten in the environmental "debate".

A large amount of carbon can, and is, captured in the soil during this process but we release it all again with our current methods of plowing & tilling the soils which releases all the captured carbon back into the atmosphere again.

Increasing the organic content in the soil:

+ Increases the amount of nutrients in the food we eat, meaning each person can eat less and still get the same level of nutrients they got before when eating 2 or even 3 times as much food.
+ Increasing the organic content will significantly lower the amount of water irrigation required for our crops, meaning we will have much more water available, alleviating the coming issue of water scarcity.
+ Decrease the amount of fertilizer necessary to grow our crop, as the natural micro-organisms & earth worms that makes the soil rich and provides the nutrients to the plant in the first place are healthier and have more food to break down for the plants with the increase of organic content. 
+ Decrease our dependence of pesticides & insecticides by increasing the health of the micro-organisms and earth worms in the topsoil.

Which will increase the resistance to pests and diseases, helping to fight off harmful bacteria and viruses, meaning we can reduce our use of pesticides by an even greater degree.

Something which the Dutch farmers here are already world champions at doing if we compare the agricultural output of the country to other countries, the fact that the government here went the literal opposite direction and instead tried to implement punitive measures instead made me think about the meaning of "anti-truth".
