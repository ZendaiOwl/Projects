## DeckOfCards
My first repository on Git. Creating a Deck of Cards that can be shuffled.

This was an automatic generated Git Repository when I created my profile. 
I decided I might as well make it as a learning experience and here it is.

It is currently very basic and I intend to make a little JavaFX GUI for it later on
