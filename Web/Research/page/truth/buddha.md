The teachings of the Buddha are aimed solely at liberating sentient beings from suffering.

Buddhism recognizes two kinds of Truth.

The apparent conventional truth and the real or ultimate Truth.

The ultimate Truth can be realized only through meditation, and not theorizing or speculating. 

The Buddha's Teaching is the Ultimate Truth of the world.

Buddhism, however, is not a revealed or an organized religion.

It is the first example of the purely scientific approach applied to questions concerning the ultimate nature of existence.

This timeless Teaching was discovered by the Buddha Himself without the help of any divine agency.

This same teaching is strong enough to face any challenge without changing the basic principles of the doctrine. Any religion that is forced to change or adjust its original Teachings to suit the modern world, is a religion that has no firm foundation and no ultimate truth in it.

Buddhism can maintain the Truth of the original Teaching of the Master even under the difficult conditions prevailing in the modern world. The Buddha did not introduce certain personal or worldly practices which have no connection with morality or religious observances.

To the Buddha, such practices have no religious value. We must make the distinction between what the Buddha taught and what people preach and practise in the name of Buddhism.

The Basic Teachings of Buddha which are core to Buddhism are:

|The Three Universal Truths|The Four Noble Truths|The Noble Eightfold Path|
|:-|:-|:-|

|I. THE THREE UNIVERSAL TRUTHS|
|:-|
||

1. Nothing is lost in the universe  
2. Everything Changes 
3. The Law of Cause and Effect

The three trainings or practices 

1. **Sila**: Virtue,  good  conduct,  morality.  This  is  based  on  two  fundamental  principles:  The principle  of  equality:  that  all  living  entities  are  equal.  The  principle  of reciprocity:  This  is the  "Golden  Rule"  in  Christianity  -  to  do  unto  others  as  you  would  wish  them  to  do unto you.  It is found in all major religions. 
 
2. **Samadhi**: Concentration,  meditation,  mental  development.  Developing  one's  mind  is  the path  to  wisdom  which,  in  turn,  leads  to  personal  freedom.  Mental  development  also strengthens and controls our mind; this helps us maintain good conduct. 
 
3. **Prajna**: Discernment,  insight,  wisdom,  enlightenment.  This  is  the  real  heart  of  Buddhism. Wisdom will emerge if your mind is pure and calm.

|II. THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS|
|:-|
|The  Buddha's Four  Noble  Truths explore  human  suffering|

They  may  be  described  (somewhat simplistically) as: 
 
1. **Dukkha**: Suffering exists: Life is suffering. Suffering is real and almost universal. Suffering has many causes: loss, sickness, pain, failure, and the impermanence of pleasure. 
 
2. **Samudaya**: There is a cause of suffering. Suffering is due to attachment.  It is the desire to have and control things. It can take many forms: craving of sensual pleasures; the desire for fame; the desire to avoid unpleasant sensations, like fear, anger or jealousy. 
 
3. **Nirodha**: There is an end to suffering. Attachment can be overcome. Suffering ceases with the final liberation of Nirvana (Nibbana). The mind experiences complete freedom, 
liberation and non-attachment. It lets go of any desire or craving. 
 
4. **Magga**: In  order  to  end  suffering,  you  must  follow  the  Eightfold  Path.  There  is  a  path  for accomplishing this.

|II.I. THE FIVE PRECEPTS|
|:-|
|These are rules to live by|

They are somewhat analogous to the second half of the Ten Commandments in Judaism and Christianity - that part of the Decalogue which describes behaviors to avoid. However, they are recommendations, not commandments. Believers are expected to use their own intelligence in deciding exactly how to apply these rules: 
 
1. **Do not kill**. This is sometimes translated as "not harming" or an absence of violence. 
 
2. **Do not steal**. This is generally interpreted as including the avoidance of fraud and economic exploitation. 
 
3. **Do not lie**. This is sometimes interpreted as including name-calling, gossip, etc. 
 
4. **Do not misuse sex**. For monks and nuns, this means any departure from complete celibacy. 
For  the  laity,  adultery  is  forbidden,  along  with  any  sexual  harassment  or  exploitation, including that within marriage. The Buddha did not discuss consensual premarital sex within a committed relationship, thus, Buddhist traditions differ on this. Most Buddhists, probably influenced by their local cultures, condemn same-sex sexual activity regardless of the nature of the relationship between the people involved. 
 
5. **Do not consume alcohol or other drugs**. The main concern here is that intoxicants cloud the mind.  Some  have  included  as  a  drug  other  methods  of  divorcing  ourselves  from  reality  -- e.g. movies, television, and the Internet.  
 
Those preparing for monastic life or who are not within a family are expected to avoid an additional five activities: 
 
**6**: Taking untimely meals.

**7**: Dancing, singing, music, watching grotesque mime. 

**8**: Use of garlands, perfumes and personal adornment. 

**9**: Use of high seats. 

**10**: Accepting gold or silver. 

There is also a series of eight precepts which are composed of the first seven listed above, followed by the eighth and ninth combined as one. "Ordained Theravada monks promise to follow 227 precepts!"

The Buddha's Eightfold Path consists of:

|Panna|
|:-|
|_Discernment, wisdom_|

**1**: **Samma ditthi**: Right Understanding of the Four Noble Truths. Right View is the true understanding of the four noble truths. 
 
**2**: **Samma sankappa**: Right thinking; following the right path in life. Right Aspiration is the true desire to free oneself from attachment, ignorance, and hatefulness. 
 
These two are referred to as *Prajna*, or *Wisdom*. 

|Sila|
|:-|
|_Virtue, morality_|

**3**: **Samma vaca**: Right speech: No lying, criticism, condemning, gossip, harsh language. Right Speech involves abstaining from lying, gossiping, or hurtful talk. 
 
**4**: **Samma kammanta**: Right conduct or Right Action involves abstaining from hurtful 
behaviors, such as killing, stealing, and careless sex. These are called the Five Precepts.   
 
**5**: **Samma  ajiva**: Right livelihood: Support yourself without harming others. Right Livelihood means making your living in such a way as to avoid dishonesty and hurting others, including animals. 
 
These three are referred to as *Shila*, or *Morality*. 

|Samadhi|
|:-|
|_Concentration, meditation_|

**6**: **Samma vayama**: Right Effort: Promote good thoughts; conquer evil thoughts. Right Effort is a matter of exerting oneself in regards to the content of one's mind: Bad qualities should be abandoned and prevented from arising again. Good qualities should be enacted and nurtured. 
 
**7**: **Samma sati**: Right Mindfulness: Become aware of your body, mind and feelings. Right Mindfulness is the focusing of one's attention on one's body, feelings, thoughts, and consciousness in such a way as to overcome craving, hatred, and ignorance. 
 
**8**: **Samma samadhi**: Right Concentration: Meditate to achieve a higher state of consciousness. Right Concentration is meditating in such a way as to progressively realize a true understanding of imperfection, impermanence, and non-separateness
