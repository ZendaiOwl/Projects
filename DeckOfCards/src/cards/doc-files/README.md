Icons by icons8.com, the links below take you to the site of the card image where I created it with their editor and the other link ia to icons8 homepage. 

These hyperlinks are a requirement for using these icons for free and should anyone decide they want to use them then the hyperlinks must be included.
They are tied to the artist for the icons and when you download an icon that is available for free a HTML hyperlink, such as the one below,
is generated as a requirement to be included with the icons.
